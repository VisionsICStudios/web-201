            <strong>I, Aaron Robert Wilson, </strong> was born in Lower Merion, PA; of which is a suburb of Philadelphia. 
            I'm a digital immigrant, can remember the day my school opened it's first computer lab. To understand me, you 
            must first understand the background of the two beautiful human beings that brought me into this world. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            My mother, Loretta, comes from a hardworking Italian-American family. A family to where almost all the men 
            became construction workers.  It is fairly safe to say that my mother's side is of mechanically inclined people. 
            My father's side is comprised of almost all art-oriented people. My father passed away when I was 8 years old. 
            He was a published poet. My grand mom is still living at 93, an author, and has two books currently for sale on 
            Amazon. My uncle has been working on Broadway for almost 40 years. My Aunt is a theatrical actress, director, 
            and a columnist for a theatrical weblog. </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I can actually fully understand why it remains my ongoing passion to become a web developer. My brain is ingrained 
            with this awesome natural marriage of an art meets mechanical mindset. It's just naturally gravitates towards 
            technological art. Web development is my calling. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Even though I currently work in healthcare, I know it is my destiny to become a web developer. I'll be the first 
            to admit that I'm raw, and I need to be guided in certain areas. On the technical side, I need work so that I can 
            understand how JavaScript works, PHP works, and so forth. Once, I do grasp it, look out, because I have a passion 
            inside to unleash on this world. I am very envious of the professional individuals that have this skillset. I look 
            up to them with respect, and want to develop that same knowledge they possess.

          to take in information and absorb it so that I learn all the techniques needed to be a developer.
